# AWS Elastic Load Balancers

## AWS Load Balancer Types
1. Classic Load Balancer
2. Network Load Balancer
3. Application Load Balancer  (k8s Ingress)

#in eks if youre not mention any loadbalancer service
its automatically takes CLB

In real time no one is using nodeport service as i practice before, in real time every company can use only ALB/CLB.
